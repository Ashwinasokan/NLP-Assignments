0|we stayed at the sandcastle resort/hotel in virginia beach for three days. our experience was less than enjoyable. to start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. they were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. when we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. i went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. after going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. at this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. we returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. i wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. i returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. after waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. we asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. when we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. the bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. at this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. we went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. we requested a refund and the manager oked it. this was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card. i've been on the phone several times but have yet to hear back from the manager about the refund. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone and am very unhappy with the way we were treated.|
0|i stayed at this hotel when i was trekking across pennsylvania to get to new york city the next day. i was extremely disappointed by my stay here! the staff ignored most of my questions and brushed those questions off of their shoulders like eh, it can wait. i was even more baffled with disgust when i entered my extremely stuffy room to find a tv that did not work, and a very low internet connection that i paid to connect to! the meal was great though, room service was mediocre at best, and the bed was surprisingly very comfortable. this hotel was by far the worst i've ever stayed at, you can tell that these people were just in it for the money and had no people skills.|
0|we had an incredible stay at the xv beacon. it started with an upgrade to a gorgeous room. the hotel is in a quaint part of boston hand the rooms are on the smaller side. however, this is made up for with the service and the decor. the room is so luxurious and comfortable. the bed linens are the highest quality i have ever seen in a hotel. the bath products are amazing as well. everywhere you look there are wonderful details. from bowls of fruit for the taking throughout the hotel to embossed leather walls in the elevator. the staff knew us by name each time we passed through the lobby and always went out of their way to be friendly towards our young daughter. the location can't be beat either. it's like staying with a friend in their brownstone in beacon hill. i would never stay anywhere else in boston.|
0|reminded me of a carnival the hotel was nice enough, but it's just crawling with people. it reminded me of a carnival--swarming with people everywhere like ants, and wherever you turn there's shops and shopkeepers trying to get you to spend money. the hotel is surrounded by shops, and as if that's not enough, ala moana shopping center is close by (more crowds and shops)! we checked out the famous diamond head beach which is close by and it was also just crowded with tourists. i felt so far removed from the actual natural beauty and charm of hawaii and couldn't wait to get out of there! i ended up staying at a quiet b&b in kailua instead--much more peaceful and beautiful.|
0|the dillon inn is a nice hotel, but i have a couple of complaints. the rooms were pretty nice, but the water in the showers didn't get as hot as i would like. also, the staff was not very friendly. when i called the front desk asking for a few extra pillows the front desk person was not very nice, and i had to walk down to get them myself. other than the lack of hot water, and the somewhat unfriendly staff, the hotel is pretty nice.|
0|the management was unfriendly, the pool was a glorified bath tub, the smoke free hotel room smelled like a tobacco field, our electronic key card stopped working at 4 am (we were returning from a wedding reception) and there was no one at the desk until 4:30. imagine being drunk and tired and having to use the toilet and having to wait 30 minutes at 4 in the morning....no thank you.|
0|i decided to stay at the japan house suites thinking that it would be just like any other motel and for the amazing rate i figured the rooms wouldn't be all that great. but, boy was i wrong. the owners were very nice, helpful, and have amazing customer service. the rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. and in the morning they make a made to order breakfast, which steak and eggs is one of the items on the menu. i couldn't believe this great hotel that i found especially for such a bargain!|
0|on my way home from a trip with my family, the drive was taking longer than expected, so we decided to stay in a hotel for the evening. it was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. the walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. when they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. the room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed big foot. overall, it was a terrible experience.|
0|this hotel was surprisingly well maintained and nice for the price. i found the room to be very clean and the bed was confortable. the wireless was lacking but data center in the lobby was such that i could work and not be distracted. i enjoyed the food in the restaurant and the bar. the staff was very pleasant and the night auditor was very helpful straightening out a problem with my bill. i'd defintely stay there again if i'm ever back in dallas and would recommend to friends visiting the area.|
0|when i visited this hotel, i thought everything was going to be great. it's appearance was not too shabby, but as soon as i got to the room, my opinion began to change. the room was nowhere near the quality that the rest of the hotel was; it only came with the basics, and nothing more. i would have expected more from a nicer hotel. the other surprising thing about this hotel was the staff. i did not feel secure at all. when i first came to my room to find my wife, she was not there (and i did not have a key). i simply came to the door, knocked, and waited one second. the maid down the hall came over and let me in the room. i could have been some stranger that was knocking on someone's room! i will not go back to that hotel because of this safety issue. thank you.|
0|i booked this hotel last week while visiting philly. i am generally a fan of hilton properties so when i called hilton they offered this hotel which they stated was 15 minutes from downtown philly. boy where they wrong. this hotel was actually a 40 minute drive from the downtown area. when my girlfriend and i checked in, we did not realize that they were renovating the lobby and certain rooms, i with the telephone representative would have stated this!! also, they gave us a corner room on the 2nd floor all the way at the rear of the building. the door to our room was ajar when we entered so i thought something was suspicious. there was a 30 minute delay in order to switch us to a different room. not a good experience. will not stay until the renovations are all done.|
0|i stayed at the ramada hotel in cordele, ga for three nights while i was visiting relatives. we tried two rooms before we found one that had working air conditioning and didn't smell of mold. the third night we were there, the air went out in the third room. we complained and received a full refund and will never return to this hotel ever again. the girl at the front desk didn't seem to care if we weren't happy at all.|
0|the sheraton garden grove anaheim south hotel is a newer built hotel on the anaheim strip, but because it is newer, the location is very far away from disneyland. unlike the pictures, the hotel itself is rather small, with an tiny outdoor pool that is surrounded by the parking lot. the staff is present at best, and any questions or concerns are quickly passed on and not adequately resolved. i was under the impression that this sheraton was the other hotel that was indeed closer to disneyland, only to my dismay that this hotel is actually closer to an old liquor store and food stall. the rooms were really cramped and were not the cleanest for being such a newly built hotel.|
0|we stayed two nights here just recently & found the place itself a great location. yes, the room is small but it did not bother us as we were hardly in the room. we had a king suite. it was called that because it had a mini sauna in the room. the room was clean & had a simple decor. do ask for a room at the back of the motel. it will be quieter than the front as you can hear the traffic from lombard. wifi was a strong signal & had no problems connecting right up. parking is first come, first serve & there is not much for the size of the place. we came in late on friday & found the last spot available & just decided to ride muni for our entire visit. it was very convenient to catch, as there was the buses that ran on lombard, chestnut & union street. when we checked in friday, the clerk was nice. checking out, another guy was very rude when we asked to leave our car a few ours, which we would have had it moved before others would be checking in & the parking lot was empty. aside from that, we did not have any interaction with the front desk staff. i would definitely stay here again as i found the rooms clean & loved the proximity to everything plus it was a reasonable price compared to other places in the area.|
0|we decided to have late evening cocktails and dessert at the living room in the peninsula, after a nice evening out. service as always was excellent as is the ambience.|
0|we recently stayed at the oceanfront hilton in virginia beach and enjoyed our stay very much. we were warmly greeted by the staff at the front desk and completed our checkin very promptly. we requested a standard room but ended up getting an oceanview room at no extra charge. the room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. the decor of the room was new and pleasing. the view was outstanding from the 8th floor and the hotel was located in a great spot which was close to activities and restaurants. the staff was very polite and willing to help us with anything we needed. they had a restaurant on the first floor that served some amazing sea food dishes and had a large selection of beer and other drinks. overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone. we were very surprised with the value of this hotel and will be staying here again on our next vacation.|
1|i arrived at terranea in need of relaxation. the property was just as beautiful as it was in the pictures. the front desk staff was very attentive and offered us champagne while we waited. my room had an amazing view and i barely wanted to leave it. there were several restaurants to choose from so we tried one each for lunch and dinner during our stay and every meal was delicious. the pools were heated and i stayed as long as i could at night. the weekend was perfect and i seriously can't wait to return!|
1|afternoon tea at the peninsula was a fabulous experience. the service was everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel, the sweet and savory little treats were exquisite and the caramel pear tea was flavorful and perfectly soothing. loved every moment of it! the belvedere restaurant was also perfect in every way! i dined at this restaurant for my birthday. the surroundings: opulent, the food: top quality, and most of all the staff made me feel very special.|
1|i arrived to a very friendly staff and a surprisingly spacious and clean room. the location was very convenient, only a short drive to downtown and the awesome south congress night life. the rooms have all your standard amenities and free wifi!!! i took advantage of the free continental breakfast every morning and saved some $$$. the cost of this hotel was better than any in town, and i am a very happy customer. i would strongly recommend this hotel and will be staying here again! thanks days inn!|
1|the hotel was great!! i loved the great view outside. the food was delicious, especially the potatoes and the creamy skim milk. the hotel was fancy and neat! i recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect view of the niagara falls.|
1|unless you care only about getting a low price and are not looking to have a pleasant stay, avoid this hotel. the staff is rude, impatient and impersonal, the rooms are poorly kept and the the food is extremely mediocre. the supplies you are given also seem pretty obviously to be bargain-bin junk. in fact, this place would be better classified as lodging than a hotel. the location however is relatively good, but there are much better hotels to consider.|
1|the design and the full description from the website was accurate in person. loved the scenery, food, workers, and the vibe around the hotel. one of the best service i seen in a long time.|
1|the holiday inn in rosslyn is a cheap hotel in a great location. there is a great view of the potomac river, it is a block away from a metro station, and a short walk to georgetown. it is also convenient to reagan national airport. the hotel also has free wifi and a restaurant/bar on the top floor that offers amazing views of washington.|
1|i have always liked and will always like the red roof inn! the management and associate staff were very friendly and courteous when helping my elderly parents and me find our hotel room. in addition, they gave us a discounted rate because we had competitor coupons! how awesome is that!? in addition, their hotel rooms are so affordable and somewhat remind me of my own home. i love the old-fashioned paintings they have in each room and the beds are amazingly comfortable. and they even offer breakfast! the good kind of breakfast too, not that processed crap you find at super 8 or other hotel / motel chains. i slept extremely sound when i stayed there; neither my family nor i had any complaints about the noise level. come to think of it, i have nothing but positive reviews for this toledo red roof inn location! i love it and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for an economic hotel in the toledo area!|
1|this hotel was a great price near the universal entrance. it's walking distance so you can save a lot of money on parking. you can also take a break from the parks and then head back out to city walk for dinner or a movie during the evening. there is a pool to relax at if you want to take it easy after a long day in the parks. the staff were friendly. the area seems safe and it was very quiet at night even thought it is close to the interstate. i would recommend this hotel.|
1|we recently stayed at the country inn and suites in mishawaka, in. the staff was very friendly and the location was convenient to everything in the area. the rooms were very spacious and they have an indoor pool. the price was also excellent for this area! i would highly recommend this hotel if you will be staying in the mishawaka / south bend area!|
1|my husband and i spent a night at a super 8 motel in n. attleboro, ma, recently. all i could think of was the bette davis line: “what a dump!” it was run down and dirty, with cramped rooms and an unfriendly staff. two of the lightbulbs in our room were burned out (although that was probably for the best, since we couldn’t see our threadbare bedspread and carpet as well as we would have otherwise!). paper-thin walls meant little sleep, and the so-called “free breakfast” meant cold coffee and hard bagels. never again!!!|
1|i absolutely hated my stay at the hilton garden inn located at 1755 s waterman ave, san bernardino, california. the staff was horribly rude and not helpful. they lost my luggage and then charged me a fee for having them find it despite it wasn't my fault for them losing it. the housekeeping failed to close my door so my laptop was stolen. the feather pillows were cheap and rancid, the feathers poked me all night long. the so called light and noise blocking curtains were anything but. i heard people in the pool all night and morning and the sunlight still came in through the curtains and made the area warm and uncomfortable. the room service was lousy, they couldn't scramble eggs if all of humanity depended on it. wifi barely worked in the room and their coin laundry took all of my tokens so i couldn't wash. their pavillon market was way too expensive, i've never paid $7.00 for one hungry man dinner ever. their fitness room consisted of one punching bag and two treadmills with three weights 5, 10 and 20 lbs.|
1|this hotel was... i stayed there about a month back, and boy, did i have problems with it. oh, the rooms were okay, but my big problem was the staff. more to the point: the staff are really inarticulate. i had to bring family, so i asked them how much it was for two rooms next to each other; they said the cost for both. i learned when i went to check out that what they meant was the cost for each and i was paying double my expectation because someone at the desk was an inarticulate, uneducated boob. what was otherwise an okay experience was just ruined by this one moment, and when you're paying twice as much for a multiple day stay, that's a pretty big moment. don't go; there's a super 8 across the street, and even though you get what you pay for, at least you'll actually know how much you're paying.|
1|if you need an inexpensive, convenient place to stay in the charleston, south carolina area, the red roof inn in north charleston is a great choice. first of all, it’s very convenient to many shopping centers, retail establishments, restaurant and the highway, so you can get almost anywhere you need to go in a short period of time. it’s also just a quick trip down the expressway from the beach and historic downtown charleston, but you don’t have to pay the ridiculous fees some of the other hotels in the area charge. the staff is friendly and our room was always very clean, and the wi-fi connection was excellent. everyone we met who worked there or stayed there was really friendly. overall, it was a great hotel in a great location at a great price. what more could you want? we will definitely be staying there again in the future.|
1|the westin in virginia beach is a rip-off. for upwards of $120/night you can have an amazing view of a parking lot. your only option is to valet your car, at $20-$25 per night, plus tips, and the rooms will make you claustrophobic. the rooms are sparse with not even a minifridge and the ac rattled all night. to save the environment, or better yet, their pockets, they turn the water pressure to the lowest possible setting in the shower. you have to specially request that they change your sheets, and i had to call several times to get the proper amount of towels in the bathroom. on top of that, there was hair all over the shower wall. paper thin walls mean you will hear your neighbors go to the bathroom, watch tv, or talk. i will never be going back again.|
1|come spend the night at this amazing property. fresh smelling rooms, clean linen, sparkling pool are just a few to name. our hotel staff is always friendly.|

BACKGROUND
:
Ischemic
heart
disease
is
the
primary
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
among
diabetics
,
especially
those
who
became
ill
at
a
young
age
.
<stop>	<stop>

More

,
this
fusion
converted
a

Reverse

analysis

Using
the

,
the
lumbosacral

Sequence

revealed
significant
differences
between
the

region
of
the
beta
subunit
gene
and
the
corresponding
regions
of
the
homologous
GlyR
alpha
subunit
genes
;
it
also
identified
a
novel
exon
(

that
encodes
most
of
the
5

portion
of
the
GlyR
beta
mRNA

we
